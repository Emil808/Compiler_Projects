An assumption made was that reserved word tokens is declared somewhere. So to add "LOOP", 
"WHEN" and "AGAIN" would be to just add those to the present list of reserved word tokens. 
The same assumption was also made for adding the "==>"/"EXIT_ARROW" special symbol. 
To add the speical symbol, we looked at the logic for two character special symbols. 
We thought we needed new a peek_char function that peeks two characters ahead, but it was not needed when looking at other examples.
